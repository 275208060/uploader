# jQuery Ajax File Uploader Widget
A jQuery plugin for file uploading using ajax(a sync); includes support for queues, progress tracking and drag and drop.

Very ***configurable*** and easy to adapt to any ***Frontend*** design, and very easy to work along side any backend logic.

The focus will be ***modern browsers***, but also providing a method to know when the plugin is not supported. The idea is to keep it simple and ***lightweight***, no need to add hacky code to add unnecessary features for the web we have nowadays.

Basic Javascript knowledge is necesary to setup this plugin: how to set parameters, callbacks, etc.

- Lightweight: ~8.00 KB 
- Dependencies: just jQuery!
